/**
 * There are two APIs we'll be using to load data, loader and useLoaderData. First we'll create and export a loader function in the root module, then we'll hook it up to the route. Finally, we'll access and render the data.
 */

/**
 *  <Form> prevents the browser from sending the request to the server and sends it to your route action instead. In web semantics, a POST usually means some data is changing. By convention, React Router uses this as a hint to automatically revalidate the data on the page after the action finishes. That means all of your useLoaderData hooks update and the UI stays in sync with your data automatically! Pretty cool.
 */

/**
 * React Router is managing all of the state behind the scenes and reveals the pieces of it you need to build dynamic web apps. In this case, we'll use the useNavigation hook.
 * 
 * useNavigation returns the current navigation state: it can be one of "idle" | "submitting" | "loading".

In our case, we add a "loading" class to the main part of the app if we're not idle. The CSS then adds a nice fade after a short delay (to avoid flickering the UI for fast loads). You could do anything you want though, like show a spinner or loading bar across the top.
